            | Speed          | Slower               | Faster after compiling   |
            | Error checking | Stops at first error | Shows all errors at once |
            | Output         | Runs directly        | Creates a separate file  |

        Interpreter --
        An interpreter reads and runs your code line by line.
        If thereâ€™s a mistake, it stops right away and shows the error.

        Example: Python, JavaScript

        Compiler --
        A compiler reads the entire code at once, checks everything, and then turns it into a separate file (machine code) that the computer can run.

        Example: C, C++
